This work presents a framework for automatic abnormal wind speed detecting and predicting by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Microcanonical Multifractal Formalism (MMF) algorithm is first used for detecting abnormal wind speed, in terms of singular exponent. Then, the proposed wind speed prediction model is trained to predict abnormal wind speed, i.e., abnormal and zero. The abnormal wind speed is decomposed by Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), then reconstructed by phase space reconstruction method. After that, Long-Short-Term Model (LSTM) is applied to predict wind speed. Three comparison experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of abnormal wind speed prediction methods. Furthermore, three databases are created for this research, and their generation method is described, so as to foster research in this direction. These three databases are used for one-hour, one-day, and non-zero abnormal wind speed prediction. Moreover, experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a higher prediction accuracy on one-hour dataset, and LSTM performs better on one-day dataset. This demonstrates that the proposed algorithm and LSTM are highly promising for abnormal wind speed prediction. # abnormal_wind_predict
